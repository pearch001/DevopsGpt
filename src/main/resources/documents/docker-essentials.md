# Docker Essentials

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
- **Image**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.
- **Container**: A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image.
- **CLI Command**: To build an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory, use: `docker build -t my-app:1.0 .`
